Once the scenario had been analyzed, a solution was developed to automate the scene using the language LADDER, from the IEC 61131-3 standard. Next, after recording the solution on the ESP32 microprocessor, the scene was communicated via Modbus Ethernet and once all the process variables had been identified, analyzed and configured in Factory IO, it was possible to control the scene via the microprocessor.
